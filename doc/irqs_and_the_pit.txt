==================
 IRQs and the PIT
==================

In this chapter we're going to be learning about interrupt requests
(IRQs) and the programmable interval timer (PIT).

Interrupt requests (theory)
===========================

There are several methods for communicating with external devices. Two
of the most useful and popular are polling and interrupting.

Polling
    Spin in a loop, occasionally checking if the device is ready.
Interrupts
    Do lots of useful stuff. When the device is ready it will cause a CPU interrupt, causing your handler to be run.

As can probably be gleaned from my biased descriptions, interrupting is
considered better for many situations. Polling has lots of uses - some CPUs may not have an
interrupt mechanism, or you may have many devices, or maybe you just
need to check so infrequently that it's not worth the hassle of
interrupts. At any rate, interrupts are a very useful method of hardware
communication. They are used by the keyboard when keys are pressed,
and also by the programmable interval timer (PIT).

The low-level concepts behind external interrupts are not very
complex. All devices that are interrupt-capable have a line connecting
them to the PIC (programmable interrupt controller). The PIC is the
only device that is directly connected to the CPU's interrupt pin. It
is used as a multiplexer, and has the ability to prioritise between
interrupting devices. It is, essentially, a glorified 8-1
multiplexer. At some point, someone somewhere realised that 8 IRQ
lines just wasn't enough, and they daisy-chained another 8-1 PIC
beside the original. So in all modern PCs, you have 2 PICs, the master
and the slave, serving a total of 15 interruptable devices (one line
is used to signal the slave PIC).

The other clever thing about the PIC is that you can change the
interrupt number it delivers for each IRQ line. This is referred to as
*remapping the PIC* and is actually extremely useful. When the
computer boots, the default interrupt mappings are:

* IRQ 0..7 - INT 0x8..0xF
* IRQ 8..15 - INT 0x70..0x77

This causes us somewhat of a problem. The master's IRQ mappings
(0x8-0xF) conflict with the interrupt numbers used by the CPU to
signal exceptions and faults (see :doc:`last chapter <the_gdt_and_idt>`). The normal
thing to do is to remap the PICs so that IRQs 0..15 correspond to ISRs
32..47 (31 being the last CPU-used ISR).

Interrupt requests (practical)
==============================

The PICs are communicated with via the I/O bus. Each has a command
port and a data port:

    * Master - command: 0x20, data: 0x21
    * Slave - command: 0xA0, data: 0xA1

The code for remapping the PICs is the most difficult and
obfusticated. To remap them, you have to do a full reinitialisation of
them, which is why the code is so long. If you're interested in what's
actually happening, there is a nice description `here`_.

::

 void init_idt()
 {
   ...
   // Remap the irq table.
   outb(0x20, 0x11);
   outb(0xA0, 0x11);
   outb(0x21, 0x20);
   outb(0xA1, 0x28);
   outb(0x21, 0x04);
   outb(0xA1, 0x02);
   outb(0x21, 0x01);
   outb(0xA1, 0x01);
   outb(0x21, 0x0);
   outb(0xA1, 0x0);
   ...
   idt_set_gate(32, (uint32_t)irq0, 0x08, 0x8E);
   ...
   idt_set_gate(47, (uint32_t)irq15, 0x08, 0x8E);
 }

Notice that now we are also setting IDT gates for numbers 32-47, for
our IRQ handlers. We must, therefore, also add stubs for these in
idt_s.s. Also, though, we need a new macro in idt_s.s - an IRQ
stub will have 2 numbers associated with it - its IRQ number (0-15)
and its interrupt number (32-47):

.. code-block:: nasm

 ; This macro creates a stub for an IRQ - the first parameter is
 ; the IRQ number, the second is the ISR number it is remapped to.
 %macro IRQ 2
   global irq%1:function irq%1.end-irq%1
   irq%1:
     cli
     push byte 0
     push byte %2
     jmp irq_common_stub
 %endmacro
  
 ...

 IRQ   0,    32
 IRQ   1,    33
 ...
 IRQ  15,    47

We also have a new common stub - *irq_common_stub*. This is because
IRQs behave subtly differently - before you return from an IRQ
handler, you must inform the PIC that you have finished, so it can
dispatch the next (if there is one waiting). This is known as an EOI
(end of interrupt). There is a slight complication though. If the
master PIC sent the IRQ (number 0-7), we must send an EOI to the
master (obviously). If the *slave* sent the IRQ (8-15), we must send
an EOI to both the master *and* the slave (because of the
daisy-chaining of the two).

First our asm common stub. It is almost identical to
*isr_common_stub*.

.. code-block:: nasm

 ; C function in idt.c
 extern irq_handler
 
 global irq_common_stub:function irq_common_stub.end-irq_common_stub
 
 ; This is our common IRQ stub. It saves the processor state, sets
 ; up for kernel mode segments, calls the C-level fault handler,
 ; and finally restores the stack frame. 
 irq_common_stub:
    pusha                    ; Pushes edi,esi,ebp,esp,ebx,edx,ecx,eax
 
    mov ax, ds               ; Lower 16-bits of eax = ds.
    push eax                 ; save the data segment descriptor
 
    mov ax, 0x10  ; load the kernel data segment descriptor
    mov ds, ax
    mov es, ax
    mov fs, ax
    mov gs, ax
    mov ss, ax
 
    push esp
    call irq_handler
 
    pop ebx                  ; reload the original data segment descriptor
    mov ds, bx
    mov es, bx
    mov fs, bx
    mov gs, bx
    mov ss, bx
 
    popa                     ; Pops edi,esi,ebp...
    add esp, 8     ; Cleans up the pushed error code and pushed ISR number
    sti
    iret           ; pops 5 things at once: CS, EIP, EFLAGS, SS, and ESP

Now the C code (goes in idt.c)::

 // This gets called from our ASM interrupt handler stub.
 void irq_handler(registers_t *regs)
 {
    if (interrupt_handlers[regs->int_no] != 0)
      interrupt_handlers[regs->int_no] (regs);
 
    // Send an EOI (end of interrupt) signal to the PICs.
    // If this interrupt involved the slave.
    if (regs.int_no >= 40)
    {
        // Send reset signal to slave.
        outb(0xA0, 0x20);
    }
    // Send reset signal to master. (As well as slave, if necessary).
    outb(0x20, 0x20);
 }

This is fairly straightforward - if the IRQ was > 7 (interrupt number
> 40), we send a reset signal to the slave. In either case, we send
one to the master also.

Some other declarations are needed:

idt.h
-----

::

 // A few defines to make life a little easier
 #define IRQ0 32
 ...
 #define IRQ15 47
 
And there we go! We can now handle interrupt requests from external
devices, and dispatch them to custom handlers. Now all we need is some
interrupt requests to handle!

The PIT (theory)
================

The programmable interval timer is a chip connected to IRQ0. It can
interrupt the CPU at a user-defined rate (between 18.2Hz and 1.1931
MHz). The PIT is the primary method used for implementing a system
clock and the only method available for implementing multitasking
(switch processes on interrupt).

The PIT has an internal clock which oscillates at approximately
1.1931MHz. This clock signal is fed through a frequency divider to modulate
the final output frequency. It has 3 channels, each with its own
frequency divider.

* Channel 0 is the most useful. Its output is connected to IRQ0.
* Channel 1 is very un-useful and on modern hardware is no longer implemented. It was used to control refresh rates for DRAM.
* Channel 2 controls the PC speaker.

Channel 0 is the only one of use to us at the moment.

OK, so we want
to set the PIT up so it interrupts us at regular intervals, at
frequency f. I generally set *f* to be about 100Hz (once every
10 milliseconds), but feel free to set it to whatever you like. To do
this, we send the PIT a 'divisor'. This is the number that it should
divide it's input frequency (1.9131MHz) by. It's dead easy to work
out:

 divisor = 1193180 Hz / frequency (in Hz)

Also worthy of note is that the PIT has 4 registers in I/O space -
0x40-0x42 are the data ports for channels 0-2 respectively, and 0x43
is the command port.

The PIT (practical)
-------------------

We'll need a few new files. timer.h has only a declaration in it:

::

 // timer.h -- Defines the interface for all PIT-related functions.
 //            Written for JamesM's kernel development tutorials.
 
 #ifndef TIMER_H
 #define TIMER_H
 
 #include "common.h"
 
 void init_timer(uint32_t frequency);
 
 #endif
 

And timer.c doesn't have much in either:

::

 // timer.c -- Initialises the PIT, and handles clock updates.
 //            Written for JamesM's kernel development tutorials.
 
 #include "common.h"
 #include "timer.h"
 #include "idt.h"
 
 uint32_t tick = 0;
 
 static void timer_callback(registers_t *regs)
 {
    tick++;
    monitor_write("Tick: ");
    monitor_write_dec(tick);
    monitor_write("\n");
 }
 
 void init_timer(uint32_t frequency)
 {
    // Firstly, register our timer callback.
    register_interrupt_handler(IRQ0, &timer_callback);
 
    // The value we send to the PIT is the value to divide it's input clock
    // (1193180 Hz) by, to get our required frequency. Important to note is
    // that the divisor must be small enough to fit into 16-bits.
    uint32_t divisor = 1193180 / frequency;
 
    // Send the command byte.
    outb(0x43, 0x36);
 
    // Divisor has to be sent byte-wise, so split here into upper/lower bytes.
    uint8_t l = (uint8_t)(divisor & 0xFF);
    uint8_t h = (uint8_t)( (divisor>>8) & 0xFF );
 
    // Send the frequency divisor.
    outb(0x40, l);
    outb(0x40, h);
 }

OK, lets go through this code. Firstly, we have our *init_timer*
function. This tells our interrupt mechanism that we want to handle
IRQ0 with the function *timer_callback*. This will be called
whenever a timer interrupt is recieved. We then calculate the divisor
to be sent to the PIT (see theory above). Then, we send a command byte
to the PIT's command port. This byte (0x36) sets the PIT to repeating
mode (so that when the divisor counter reaches zero it's automatically
refreshed) and tells it we want to set the divisor value.

We then send the divisor value. Note that it must be sent as two
seperate bytes, not as one 16-bit value.

When this is done, all we have to do is add two
line to main.c;

::

 init_timer (20); // Initialise timer to 20Hz
 
 asm volatile("sti");

The "sti" instruction allows external interrupts to be handled. You
should get output like that on the right. Note however that bochs does
not accurately emulate the timer chip, so although your code will run
at the correct speed on a real machine, it probably won't in bochs!
