=================
 The GDT and IDT
=================

The GDT and the IDT are descriptor tables. They are arrays of flags
and bit values describing the operation of either the segmentation
system (in the case of the GDT), or the interrupt vector table (IDT).

They are, unfortunately, a little theory-heavy, but bear with it
because it'll be over soon!

The Global Descriptor Table
===========================

Theory
------

The x86 architecture has two methods of memory protection and of
providing virtual memory - segmentation and paging.

With segmentation, every memory access is evaluated with respect to a
segment. That is, the memory address is added to the segment's base
address, and checked against the segment's length. You can think of a
segment as a window into the address space - the process does not know
it's a window, all it sees is a linear address space starting at zero
and going up to the segment length.

With paging, the address space is split into (usually 4KB, but this can
change) blocks, called pages. Each page can be mapped into physical
memory - mapped onto what is called a 'frame'. Or, it can be
unmapped. Like this you can create virtual memory spaces.

Both of these methods have their advantages, but paging is much
better. Segmentation is, although still usable, fast becoming obsolete
as a method of memory protection and virtual memory. In fact, the
x86-64 architecture requires a flat memory model (one segment with a
base of 0 and a limit of 0xFFFFFFFF) for some of it's instructions to
operate properly.

Segmentation is, however, totally in-built into the x86
architecture. It's impossible to get around it. So here we're going to
show you how to set up your own Global Descriptor Table - a list of
segment descriptors.

As mentioned before, we're going to try and set up a flat memory
model. The segment's window should start at 0x00000000 and extend to
0xFFFFFFFF (the end of memory). However, there is one thing that
segmentation can do that paging can't, and that's *set the ring level*. 

A ring is a privilege level - zero being the most privileged,
and three being the least. Processes in ring zero are said to be
running in *kernel-mode*, or *supervisor-mode*, because they can
use instructions like *sti* and *cli*, something which most
processes can't. Normally, rings 1 and 2 are unused. They can,
technically, be allowed to access a greater subset of the supervisor-mode
instructions than ring 3 can. Some microkernel architectures use these
for running *server processes*, or drivers.

A segment descriptor carries inside it a number
representing the ring level it applies to. To change ring levels
(which we'll do later on), among other things, we need segments that
represent both ring 0 and ring 3.

Practical
---------

OK, that was one humongous chunk
of theory, lets get into the nitty gritty of implementing this.

One thing I forgot to mention is that GRUB sets a GDT up for you. The
problem is that, similar to GRUB's stack, you don't know where that GDT is, or what's in it. So
you could accidentally overwrite it, then your computer would
triple-fault and reset. Not clever.

In the x86, we have 6 segmentation registers. Each holds an offset
into the GDT. They are CS (code segment), DS (data segment), ES (extra
segment), FS, GS, SS (stack segment). The code segment *must*
reference a descriptor which is set as a 'code segment'. There is a
flag for this in the access byte. The rest should all reference a
descriptor which is set as a 'data segment'.

gdt.h
~~~~~

A GDT entry looks like this:

.. literalinclude:: ../src/gdt.h
    :start-after: init_gdt ();
    :end-before: // This struct describes a GDT pointer.

Most of those fields should be
self-explanatory. The format of the access byte is given here:

.. image:: gdt_idt_gdt_format_2.png

and the format of the granularity byte is here:

.. image:: gdt_idt_gdt_format_1.png

P
    Is segment present? (1 = Yes)
DPL
    Descriptor privilege level - Ring 0 - 3.
DT
    Descriptor type
Type
    Segment type - code segment / data segment.
G
    Granularity (0 = 1 byte, 1 = 4kbytes)
D
    Operand size (0 = 16bit, 1 = 32bit)
0
    Should always be zero.
A
    Available for system use (always zero).

To tell the processor where to find our GDT, we have to give it the
address of a special pointer structure:

.. literalinclude:: ../src/gdt.h
    :start-after: gdt_entry_t
    :end-before: #endif

The base is the address of the first entry in our GDT, the limit being
the size of the table minus one (the last valid address in the table).

Those struct definitions should go in a header file,
gdt.h, along with a prototype.

::

    // Initialisation function.
    void init_gdt();

gdt.c
~~~~~

In gdt.c, we have a few declarations:

.. NB: must include code here because of all the #ifs in this file.

::

    //
    // gdt.c - Initialises the GDT and IDT, and defines the 
    //         default ISR and IRQ handler.
    //         Based on code from Bran's kernel development tutorials.
    //         Rewritten for JamesM's kernel development tutorials.
    //
    
    #include "common.h"
    #include "gdt.h"
    
    // Lets us access our ASM functions from our C code.
    extern void gdt_flush (uint32_t);
    
    // Internal function prototypes.
    static void gdt_set_gate (int32_t,uint32_t,uint32_t,uint8_t,uint8_t);
    
    // The GDT itself.
    gdt_entry_t gdt_entries [3];
    
    // Pointer structure to give to the CPU.
    gdt_ptr_t gdt_ptr;


Notice the gdt_flush function - this will be defined in an ASM file,
and will load our GDT pointer for us.

::

    void init_gdt ()
    {
      // The limit is the last valid byte from the start of the GDT - i.e. the size of the GDT - 1.
      gdt_ptr.limit = sizeof (gdt_entry_t) * 3 - 1;
      gdt_ptr.base = (uint32_t) &gdt_entries;
      
      gdt_set_gate (0, 0, 0, 0, 0);             // Null segment.
      gdt_set_gate (1, 0, 0xFFFFF, 0x9A, 0xCF); // Code segment.
      gdt_set_gate (2, 0, 0xFFFFF, 0x92, 0xCF); // Data segment.
      
      // Inform the CPU about our GDT.
      gdt_flush ((uint32_t) &gdt_ptr);
    }

.. literalinclude:: ../src/gdt.c
    :start-after: }
    :end-before: #endif


Lets just analyse that code for a moment. init_gdt initially sets up
the gdt pointer structure - the limit is the size of each gdt entry *
3 - we have 3 entries. Why 3? well, we have a code and data segment
descriptor for the kernel, and a null entry. This *must* be present, or Bad Things will happen.

gdt_init then sets up the 3 descriptors, by calling
gdt_set_gate. gdt_set_gate just does some severe bit-twiddling and
shifting, and should be self-explanatory with a hard stare at it.
Notice that the only thing that changes between the 2 segment
descriptors is the access byte - 0x9A, 0x92. You can see,
if you map out the bits and compare them to the format diagram above,
the bits that are changing are the type field. Type specifies whether the segment is a code segment or a data
segment (the processor checks this often, and can be the source of
much frustration).

Finally, we have our ASM function that will write the GDT
pointer.

gdt_s.s
~~~~~~~
.. literalinclude:: ../src/gdt_s.s
    :language: nasm

This function takes the first parameter passed to it (in esp+4), loads
the value it points to into the GDT (using the lgdt instruction), then
loads the segment selectors for the data and code segments. Notice
that each GDT entry is 8 bytes, and the kernel code descriptor is the
second segment, so it's offset is 0x08. Likewise the kernel data
descriptor is the third, so it's offset is 16 = 0x10. Here we move the
value 0x10 into the data segment registers DS,ES,FS,GS,SS. To change
the code segment is slightly different; we must do a far jump. This
changes the CS implicitly.

The Interrupt Descriptor Table
==============================

Theory
------

There are times when you want to interrupt the processor. You want to
stop it doing what it is doing, and force it to do something
different. An example of this is when an timer or keyboard
interrupt request (IRQ) fires. An interrupt is like a POSIX
signal - it tells you that something of interest has happened. The
processor can register 'signal handlers' (interrupt handlers) that deal
with the interrupt, then return to the code that was running before it
fired. Interrupts can be fired externally, via IRQs, or internally,
via the 'int n' instruction. There are very useful reasons for wanting
to do fire interrupts from software, but that's for another chapter!

The *Interrupt Descriptor Table* tells the processor where to find
handlers for each interrupt. It is very similar to the GDT. It is just
an array of entries, each one corresponding to an interrupt
number. There are 256 possible interrupt numbers, so 256 must be
defined. If an interrupt occurs and there is no entry for it (even a
NULL entry is fine), the processor will panic and reset.

Faults, traps and exceptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The processor will sometimes need to signal your kernel. Something major may have happened, such as a divide-by-zero, or a page fault. To do this, it uses the first 32 interrupts. It is therefore doubly important that all of these are mapped and non-NULL - else the CPU will triple-fault and reset (bochs will panic with an 'unhandled exception' error).

The special, CPU-dedicated interrupts are shown below.

==     ==================================================
ID     Description
==     ==================================================
0      Division by zero exception
1      Debug exception
2      Non maskable interrupt
3      Breakpoint exception
4      'Into detected overflow'
5      Out of bounds exception
6      Invalid opcode exception
7      No coprocessor exception
8      Double fault *(pushes an error code)*
9      Coprocessor segment overrun
10     Bad TSS *(pushes an error code)*
11     Segment not present *(pushes an error code)*
12     Stack fault *(pushes an error code)*
13     General protection fault *(pushes an error code)*
14     Page fault *(pushes an error code)*
15     Unknown interrupt exception
16     Coprocessor fault
17     Alignment check exception
18     Machine check exception
19-31  Reserved
=========================================================

Practical
---------

idt.h
~~~~~

Just like the GDT, there are some structures that need defining:

.. literalinclude:: ../src/idt.h
    :start-after: #endif // CHAPTER >= 5
    :end-before: #if CHAPTER >= 5

.. image:: gdt_idt_idt_format_1.png

See? Very similar to the GDT entry and ptr structs. The flags field
format is shown above. The lower 5-bits should be constant at
0b0110 - 6 in decimal. The DPL describes the privilege level we
expect to be called from - in our case zero, but as we progress we'll
have to change that to 3. The P bit signifies the entry is
present. Any descriptor with this bit clear will cause a "Interrupt
Not Handled" exception.

idt.c
~~~~~
.. literalinclude:: ../src/idt.c
    :start-after: #if CHAPTER >= 4
    :end-before: #if CHAPTER >= 5
.. literalinclude:: ../src/idt.c
    :start-after: #endif // CHAPTER >= 5
    :end-before: #if CHAPTER >= 5
.. literalinclude:: ../src/idt.c
    :start-after: // Tell the CPU about our new IDT
    :end-before: // This gets called from our ASM interrupt handler stub

idt_s.s
~~~~~~~~~~~
We need to define the idt_flush function in assembler:

.. literalinclude:: ../src/idt_s.s
    :language: nasm
    :end-before: ; This macro creates

Great! We've got code that will tell the CPU where to find our
interrupt handlers - but we haven't written any yet!

When the processor receives an interrupt, it saves the contents of the
essential registers (instruction pointer, stack pointer, code and data
segments, flags register) to the stack. It then finds the interrupt
handler location from our IDT and jumps to it.

Now, just like POSIX signal handlers, you don't get given any information
about what interrupt was called when your handler is run. So,
unfortunately, we can't just have one common handler, we must write a
different handler for each interrupt we want to handle. This involves a lot of grind, so like good engineers we want to keep the amount of duplicated code to a
minimum. We do this by writing many handlers that just push the
interrupt number (hardcoded in the ASM) onto the stack, and call a
common handler function.

Unfortunately we have another problem - some
interrupts also push an error code onto the stack. We can't call a
common function without a common stack frame, so for those that don't
push an error code, we push a dummy one, so the stack is the same.

.. code-block:: nasm

 global isr0
 isr0:
   cli                 ; Disable interrupts
   push byte 0         ; Push a dummy error code (if ISR0 doesn't push it's own error code)
   push byte 0         ; Push the interrupt number (0)
   jmp isr_common_stub ; Go to our common handler.

That sample routine will work, but 32 versions of that still sounds
like a lot of code. We can use NASM's macro facility to cut this down,
though:

.. literalinclude:: ../src/idt_s.s
    :language: nasm
    :start-after: ; error code (adds a dummy errcode byte).
    :end-before: ; This macro creates a stub for an IRQ

We can now make a stub handler function just by doing

.. code-block:: nasm

 ISR_NOERRCODE 0
 ISR_NOERRCODE 1
 ...

Much less work, and anything that makes our lives easier is worth
doing. A quick look at the intel manual will tell you that only
interrupts 8, 10-14 inclusive push error codes onto the stack. The
rest require dummy error codes.

*We're almost there, I promise!*

Only 2 more things left to do - one is to create an ASM common handler
function. The other is to create a higher-level C handler function.

.. literalinclude:: ../src/idt_s.s 
    :language: nasm
    :start-after: ; C function in idt.c
    :end-before: ; C function in idt.c

This piece of code is our common interrupt handler. It firstly uses
the 'pusha' command to push all the general purpose registers on the
stack. It uses the 'popa' command to restore them at the end. It also
gets the current data segment selector and pushes that onto the
stack, sets all the segment registers to the kernel data
selector, and restores them afterwards. This won't actually have an
effect at the moment, but it will when we switch to user-mode. Notice
it also calls a higher-level interrupt handler - *idt_handler*.

When an interrupt fires, the processor automatically pushes
information about the processor state onto the stack. The code
segment, instruction pointer, flags register, stack segment and stack
pointer are pushed. The IRET instruction is specifically designed to
return from an interrupt. It pops these values off the stack and
returns the processor to the state it was in originally.

idt.c, again
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In idt.c, we define the handler function and a quick way of registering interrupt handlers.

.. literalinclude:: ../src/idt.c
    :start-after: // This gets called from our ASM interrupt handler stub
    :end-before: #if CHAPTER >= 5

Here we use a simple interrupt dispatch system. an *interrupt_handler_t* is typedefed
as a function pointer, taking one argument. It uses
a structure registers_t, which is a representation of all the
registers we pushed, and we defined in idt.h.

Testing it out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we can test it out - Add this to your main() function:

::

 init_gdt();
 init_idt();
 asm volatile ("int $0x3");

.. image:: gdt_idt_bochs.png

This causes a software interrupt. You should see the
message printed out just like the screenshot above (as you don't have a handler registered for interrupt 3 yet)

Congratulations! You've now got a kernel that can handle interrupts, and set
up its own segmentation tables (a pretty hollow victory, considering
all that code and theory, but unfortunately there's no getting around it!).
